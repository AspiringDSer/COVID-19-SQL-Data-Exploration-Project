SQL - COVID-19 Data Exploration Project

This portfolio piece is to demonstrate some of my SQL skills. 
Skills used: Joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Window Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, Converting Data Types 

Dataset: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths
Data pulled on July 6th 2021

I split the original dataset into two csv files: cleaned_owid_covid_data.csv -> CovidDeaths.csv + CovidVaccinations.csv 

Please checkout my COVID-19 Tableau Dashboard Project. I also used SQL queries to create tables to connect with Tableau.
